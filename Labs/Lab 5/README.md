A TreeNode needed to be compared to its parent and the previous parent. In order to do this, I made a second function that had three parameters, the root of the subtree that needed to be checked, the lower bound, and the upper bound. First I made the base case and checked if the root was null. If it was then the function returned true. Then it checked if the root node was within the lower and upper bounds. If not the function would return false. Then I returned the value of a recursive call with the left child, the lower bound, and the root value anded with a recursive call with the right child, the root value, and the upper bound.

The recursive call with the left child, the lower bound, and the root value was to compare the left subtree with the lower bound as the original lower bound and the upper bound as the root value. This was to make sure that all nodes in the left subtree are less than the root value. 

The recursive call with the right child, the root value, and the upper bound was to compare the right subtree with the lower bound as the root value and the upper bound as the original upper bound. This was to make sure that all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the root value.
