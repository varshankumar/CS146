I made a loop through all the values of the courses in a loop. For each class, I checked if there was a cycle. To check if there was a cycle, I made a second function, findCycle, which looped through the prerequisites and checked if the first value was the current course. If it was then we check if we have already visited that course in the iteration. If we have visited, then we return false. Otherwise, we add the current course to the visited list and return the recursive call to findCycle with the original course, the current course, the prerequisite graph, and the visited list. after looping through all the prerequisites and if there are no cycles we return true. This algorithm follows each node in the graph and checks if there are any cycles.
