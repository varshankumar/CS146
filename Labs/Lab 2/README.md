I first converted the two strings, s and t, into arrays. Then, I sorted the arrays based on the character values. I checked to see if the two arrays were equal in value to each other. If they were equal, the program would print "YES" to indicate that the two strings were anagrams. Otherwise, it would print "NO" to indicate that they were not anagrams. This method works because anagrams have the same letters and the same number of each letter. After sorting both arrays, anagrams would have equal values because the order of the letters would be the same and the quantity of each letter would be the same. Both of these can be indicated by seeing if the two lists are equal in value. The order of the elements of the array would be the same and the quantity of each unique value element would be the same.
