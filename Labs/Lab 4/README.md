To invert the binary tree, I made the base case where if the root was null, then the fucntion would return null. Then I swapped the right and left children of the root. Then I recursively called the function twice, once with the left child as the root parameter and once with the right child as the root parameter. This would ensure that all the subchildren would be inverted. Once the function reached the end of the tree, it would return null as indicated by the base case.
