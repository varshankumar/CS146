I used the tabulation technique to calculate the minimum number of coins necessary to have for an amount. First, I made an array from amount+1 length to represent the minimum number of coins it would take to represent amounts 0 to amount. I set all the values to amount+1 except the first value representing 0 amount to 0. Then for each amount, I iterated through all the coin values and if it was less than the amount and if the change array had a value that had fewer coins than what it would currently take to represent the amount, then the value for the amount would be updated to the value that had fewer coins + 1. Then I would return the last value if it was less than or equal to the amount. Otherwise, I would return -1.
