I used a HashMap in Java and a dictionary in Python and used the elements in the nums array as keys mapped to the value of (target - key) as the values. This created a data structure in which I could check pairs and see if the key and value were both contained in the nums array. If they were contained in the nums array, I would print the indexes of the key and value relative to their position in the nums array. Since I used an enhanced loop to loop over the values in nums for the outer loop, I used a variable to store the value of the index of the first number we were checking. The inner loop was a regular incremental loop, so the index of the second number was just the loop variable. Since each pair in the Map summed to the target, if the key and value were in the nums array, then they would be valid solutions to the problem. 

In the Python code, I had to create a flag variable to check if a pair had been found in order to break out of the outer loop. I was able to use the return statement in Java to break out of both loops since I wrote the code in the main method.
