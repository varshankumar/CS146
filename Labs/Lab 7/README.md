I used the Floyd Warshall algorithm to find the distance from each city to all the other cities. The distances were stored in a n*n matrix. Then, I looped though each row of the matrix associated with a single city and counted the cities that were less than or equal to the distance threshold. Then I returned the city with the least amount of cities that were within the distance threshold.
