I used a version of Prim's algorithm to find the combination of minimum spanning trees that would result in the lowest cost. First I made an empty visited list to represent the houses that could get water. Then, I made a loop that iterated until the visited list length was equal to n, the number of houses that needed water. 
First I checked the house that would cost the least to put a well in, that did not already have access to water. I did this by looping through all the wells and seeing if they were not already in visited and were less than the minimum well cost so far. I stored the minimum cost and the house number in two variables.
Second, I checked the house that it would cost the least to put a pipe in from another house in the visited list. I did this by looping through the visited list and checked if they had any connections to other houses. I checked if the house had any connections and the connected house was not already in visited, and the cost was less than the pipe cost so far. I stored the minimum cost to connect two houses and the connected house in two variables.
Finally, I compared the cost to make a well in a house vs connecting two houses with a pipe. If making a well in the house was cheaper, I incremented the cost by the cost to make the well in the house and then added the house to visited. If connecting a house by pipes was cheaper, I incremented cost by the cost to make the pipes and added the house to visited. Then I returned the value of cost.
