Insertion sort has a time complexiy of O(n^2).
Insertion sort checks with two loops. The outer loop iterates  n-1 times. The inner loop iterates i-1 times where i is incremented to n.
The number of iterations for the worst and average case would be (n-1)*(i-1) which approximates to time complexity O(n^2).
