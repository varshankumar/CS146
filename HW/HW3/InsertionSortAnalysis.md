Insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n^2).
Insertion sort checks with two loops. 
The outer loop iterates n-1 times. 
The inner loop iterates i-1 times where i is incremented to n.

Since both these values (n-1 and i-1) are variable, we can denote them with n.

The number of iterations for the worst and average case would be (n-1)*(i-1) which approximates to n * n or n^2.

Therefore, the time complexity would be O(n^2).
