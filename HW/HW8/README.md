I first had an integer variable to hold the count of the highest occurring character that appeared an odd number of times and set it to -1. Then I had a variable for the length of the longest possible palindrome. Then I had a dictionary object for Python, and a HashMap object in Java to hold the counts of all the characters. I looped through the string and incremented the values of each character to get a map of characters to their respective count. Then I looped through the values in the map and checked if the value was even. If the value was even, I would add it to the length variable. If the value was odd, I would check if it was the highest odd count so far and if so, I would update the highest odd count variable. Finally, I checked to see if the highest odd variable was not equal to -1, the initial value, to check if there were any odd counts. If there was, then I would add it to the length. Then I would return the length variable.
