First I stored the original color of the pixel in an int variable. Then I stored the number of rows as m and the number of columns as n. Then I checked if the original color of the pixel was the same as the new color; if it was, then I returned the image grid. If not, I changed the pixel color to the new color. Then, if they existed, I checked if the top, bottom, left, and right pixels were the original color. If they existed and they matched the original color, I made a recursive call to the floodFill function with the new image grid, the respective pixel coordinates, and the new color and set the original image grid to the returned image grid. Then finally I returned the image grid.
