I used a PriorityQueue (max heap) to arrange the intervals with the priority being the end time. Fist I sorted the array in order of start time to place intervals into the heap in order of start time. Then I iterated through the intervals list and checked if the priority queue was not empty and if the top value was greater than or equal to the start value of the current interval. If this condition was met, then would remove the top item. After the check, regardless of the outcome, I added the end time value into the priority queue. At the end of the loop the size of the priority queue would indicate how many serers are neeeded so I returned the size of the priority queue.
