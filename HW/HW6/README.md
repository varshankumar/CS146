I used a brute force algorithm to check all combinations of the elements and checked to see if the sum of the three integers was 0. In Java, I used a HashSet to hold all the triplets (as an ArrayList) that have a sum of zero. I used a HashSet so that there would be no duplicate triplets. To ensure that triplets that had a sum of 0 with elements in a different order did not get put into the HashSet, I sorted the input array at the beginning of the program. This ensured that the elements would be checked in ascending order, which meant the arrangement of elements in the input array would not lead to triplets with the same elements but in different arrangements. In Python, I used a list instead of a set. Since I could not add a triplet list to a set, I had to do a manual check to see if the triplet list already existed in the return list.
