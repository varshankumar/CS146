I used the BFS algorithm to traverse the tree. I made a queue for the search and made a 2D result list to hold the output. First I checked if the root was null, and if so I returned null. I added the root to the queue. Then I made a loop that loops while the queue is not empty. I created a level list to hold the nodes of the current level. Then I made an int variable to hold the current size of the queue which was also how many nodes were in that level. Then I made a loop that iterated the current size of the queue times. In the loop, I took out the first element, added it to the level list, then added the children to the queue. After the loop, I added the level list to the result list. After the queue was empty, the outer loop would end and I returned the result list.
