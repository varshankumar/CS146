First I checked if the root was null. If the root was null then I returned null. Then I checked if p and q values were larger than the root value. If so, then I recursively called the function again with the root parameter as the right child of the root leaving p and q the same. If both values are larger than the root, then the least common ancestor must be on the right side of the root. If p and q were not greater than the root , I checked if they were less than the root. If so, then I recursively called the function again with the root parameter as the left child of the root leaving p and q the same. If both values are smaller than the root, then the least common ancestor must be on the left side of the root. If p and q were not both greater than or less than the root, I returned the root since this meant p and q were on opposite sides of the root.
