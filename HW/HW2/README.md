I used a binary search to look for the version that was bad and had a good version directly before it. This indicated that that version is the first bad version. For the corner case where all the versions are bad, the regular check would not work because the first bad version would be the first version, but we cannot check if the previous version is good because there is no version before the first version. For this corner case, I first checked if the first version is bad at the beginning of the program.
